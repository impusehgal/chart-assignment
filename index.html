    <p>The borough of Bronx is synonymous with the name "asthma alley." Since the past many years, the number of asthma cases in kids has been visibly higher in comparison to the other boroughs of New York City. We have sourced data on asthma emergency department visits among kids aged 5-17 from the NYC EH Data Portal.</p>
  <p> According to the data, the total number of emergency visits were 63029, as observed in the time period of 2017-2019, and Bronx accounts for 36.2% (22,822) of these hospital visits. Meanwhile, Staten Insland only had 1,853 emergency visits in the three-year period-- the least out of all the five boroughs. </p>

       <p> According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, excess particluate matter (PM 2.5) and an uptick in cases of rodent infestations are possible triggers for asthma among kids. Increased traffic on the Cross Bronx Expressway and expedited development of warehouses and housing units along the waterfront has had a drastic impact on the borough's air quality. The chart below analyzes the current levels of particulate matter in the South Bronx (areas like Mott Haven, Port Morris, Hunts Point and Longwood) against the levels in other parts of the city.</p>

   <p> "Honestly, these numbers aren't shocking at all," said Nilka Martell. Martell is an environmental activist and board chair of the Bronx River Alliance. Martell's son has childhood asthma which she believes is linked to pollution from the Cross Bronx expressway. To clean the air and create new access to greenways and parks, she is now advocating for capping of the Cross Bronx Expressway.</p>

   <p> Four community fridges and numerous pantries: At the fundraising brunch, Grassroots Grocery, along with their partner Gotham Food Pantry, christened a new community fridge that will be installed near the Fredrick Douglass Houses on the Upper West Side. This fridge marks their first expansion outside of the Bronx area. Previously Grassroots Grocery has opened up three more community fridges in the Bronx-- two in the Mott Haven neighbourhood and one in Co-Op city. They also trasnport food to other hub areas owned by Gotham Food Pantry and similar organizations around the city. </p>

   <p> Promoting the Brand: To reflect the organization’s growth beyond its humble beginnings in the South Bronx, Dan Zauderer decided to update their name to Grassroots Grocery. He said he feels the universal connotation better captures the work he and his volunteers are doing. His ultimate hope is that the rebrand will give a sense that they are part of a larger movement. Zauderer said the rebrand effort is ongoing, with a <a href="https://www.grassrootsgrocery.org"> new website </a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grassrootsgroceryny/?hl=en"> updated social media handles</a> serving as visible signs of progress. The organization also caught the attention of Kelly Clarkson, who invited Daniel Zauderer on her show. Check out the video here.</p>
